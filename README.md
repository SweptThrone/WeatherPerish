# Weather Perish

### ⚠️ DEPRECATED ⚠️  
This project is very old and never got much testing.  
I believe it uses a deprecated function.  
Do not rely on it working perfectly.  

## Description  

WeatherPerish is a simple plugin for Minecraft Spigot servers that lets you  
curse the skies when it starts raining.  

Whenever it starts raining in a world, if you say "die", "no", or "perish"  
within five seconds, the rain stops.  

That's it. This one's just a dumb fun quick plugin.
